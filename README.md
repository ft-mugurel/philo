# 42 Philosophers Project

The **Philosophers** project is an introduction to multithreading and concurrency in programming. The goal is to solve the classic "Dining Philosophers Problem," where multiple threads (philosophers) compete for shared resources (forks) without causing deadlocks or data races.

This project focuses on understanding thread synchronization, mutexes, and resource management. You'll implement a solution using either threads or processes, ensuring that all philosophers can eat, think, and sleep without starving or crashing the program.

By completing this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of concurrent programming, thread safety, and how to handle shared resources efficiently.
